# 06-Five-Day-Weather-Forecast

## Description

Check your Five day weather forecast with Sky Guy's eye on the Sky.

Not the best but also not the worst way to check weather around the world. With this project you're able to search your location (unfortunately not by hitting enter you have to hit the search button with ya click) and get next five days forcast. Now I'm gonna be real with you. I realized that I should have been fetching the weather api to get the current weather data so big L on that one. 

It will however remind you of what city you looked up and return weather conditions, temp, humidity, windspeed, as well as a fun lil icon.
It also will loop through the next 5 days and give you a forcast for them as well.

If I had more time I could have also included an option to include history by appending your local storage history to the hamburger menu but unfortunately between this assignment and not wanting to let my group down I'd rather sacrifice my grade than theirs.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
